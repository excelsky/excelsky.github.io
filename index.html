  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    🫡 Hi, I am Kicho Yu. I go by either Kicho or SGT Yu. <br><br>
    💻 I am Computer Science Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://www.usc.edu/"> USC (University of Southern California)</a> in <a href="https://ant.isi.edu/">the ANT (Analysis of Network Traffic) Lab</a>, where I am advised by <a href="https://www.isi.edu/~johnh/">Professor John Heidemann</a>.<br><br>
    🛡️ I am particularly interested in network security to share network traffic without compromising privacy and security. <br><br>
    🔢 Before I joined USC, I worked as a data scientist / analyst / engineering in San Francisco Bay Area at numerous companies such as Lyft and Allstate (SquareTrade) and AnchorFree.
